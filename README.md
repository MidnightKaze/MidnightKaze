### It's Nice to Meet You ãƒ¾(â€¢Ì€ ãƒ® <)Ùˆ
âœ¨ Heyo I'm __Caitlyn Nguyen__! I'm a first year Computer Science student at Warren Tech Central and I'm also a Junior at Arvada West High School. I'm pretty interested in a lot of topics revolving around AI and Machine Learning, but since I'm pretty new to the CS field I'm open to learning almost anything. Aside from that I also love the hardware side of computers.

I'm not a total nerd, but on the side of my school work I love to write novels. I'm currently working on quite a few right now ï¼¿ã€†(ã€‚ã€‚)
